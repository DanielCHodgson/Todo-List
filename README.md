# 📝 Todo List App

This project was a great learning experience, but let’s be honest—it’s a bit of a mess. The code could be cleaner, the architecture could be more refined, and if I started over from scratch, it would be way better. That said, it still has a solid set of features, and it was a fun build!

If you're looking for a well-structured, polished to-do app… this isn't it. But if you're curious about the learning process, want to play around with some cool features, or feel like refactoring a messy project, go for it!

## ✅ Features
• ✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks – Basic task management functionality  
• 📂 Add and delete projects – Organize tasks into projects  
• 🏠 Dashboard with filtered swimlanes – View tasks by category/status  
• 🔄 Drag and drop tasks between swimlanes – Reorganize tasks easily  
• 🌗 Switch between light and dark mode – Choose your preferred theme  
• 🚀 Start fresh or load a demo environment – Either begin with a blank slate or test with dummy data  

## ❌ Missing Features
• 🔄 Ability to rearrange swimlanes – Let users change the order of swimlanes  
• 🖼 Ability to add custom profile images – Personalize user profiles with custom images  
• 🔍 Task search – Quickly find tasks by name or category  
• 🛍️ ...many more! 

## 🚧 Things That Could Be Better
• 🏗 Messy architecture – This was more of a "figure it out as I go" project than a well-planned one. It's truly some of the worst code I've ever written.
• 🐢 Some inefficiencies – There are areas where performance could be optimized  
• 🎨 UI could use polish – It's functional but not the prettiest app out there  
• 🔄 State management could be improved – Things work, but it’s nowhere near as clean as it should be. 

## Final Thoughts
Would I build this the same way again? Absolutely not. But did I learn a lot from it? Definitely. If you want to check it out, improve it, or just see what not to do, feel free to dive in! 😄
